Next + Firebase + Tailwind

## Before Getting Started
This application will not work on it's own. You will need to create a firebase project and configure a `.env.local` so that it is able to communicate with your backend.

## Getting Started
Install the dependancies
`npm i`

Run the server
`npm run dev`
