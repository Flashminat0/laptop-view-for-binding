Next + Firebase + Tailwind

## Before Getting Started
This application will not work on it's own. You will need to create a firebase project and configure a `.env.local` so that it is able to communicate with your backend.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository
`https://github.com/damiensedgwick/next-firebase-tailwind.git`

Change to project directory
`cd next-firebase-tailwind`

Install the dependancies
`npm i`

Run the server
`npm run dev`
