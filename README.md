Next + Firebase + Tailwind

## Before Getting Started
This application will not work on it's own. You will need to create a firebase project and configure a `.env.local` so that it is able to communicate with your backend.

To see it working before this, you can visit the demo [here](https://splendid-daffodil-c59f97.netlify.app/)

`https://github.com/damiensedgwick/next-firebase-tailwind.git`
